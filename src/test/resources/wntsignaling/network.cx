The extracellular Wnt signal stimulates several intra-cellular signal transduction cascades. The three best-characterized WNT pathways are shown: the canonical or Wnt/Beta-catenin dependent pathway and the non-canonical or Beta-catenin-independent pathway, that can be divided into the Planar Cell Polarity pathway, which is prominently involved in the regulation of cell polarity, cell motility and morphogenetic movements; and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway, which regulates the transcription of genes controlling cell fate and cell migration."}, {"n":"organism","v":"Homo Sapiens (human)"}, {"n":"rightsHolder","v":"Prof. Gianni Cesareni"}, {"n":"rights","v":"Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)"}, {"n":"reference","v":"<div>Perfetto L., <i>et al.</i></div><div><b>SIGNOR: a database of causal relationships between biological entities</b><i>.</i></div><div>Nucleic Acids Res. 2016 Jan 4;44(D1):D548-54</div><div><span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkv1048\" target=\"_blank\">doi: 10.1093/nar/gkv1048</a></span></div>"}, {"n":"version","v":"22-Sep-2020"}, {"n":"networkType","v":["pathway","Signalling Pathway"],"d":"list_of_string"}, {"n":"prov:wasGeneratedBy","v":"<a href=\"https://github.com/ndexcontent/ndexsignorloader\">ndexsignorloader 1.1.0</a>"}, {"n":"__normalizationversion","v":"0.1"}, {"n":"prov:wasDerivedFrom","v":"https://signor.uniroma2.it/pathway_browser.php?organism=&pathway_list=SIGNOR-WNT"}]},
